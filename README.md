# Action-Network-Daily-NBA-Lines
This Python script scrapes NBA game odds from the Action Network website and writes the data into a CSV file. The script retrieves betting information for each game of the day, including spreads, totals (over/under), and moneylines, and saves the data for later use, such as analysis or prediction modeling.

**Features**
Scrapes NBA betting odds from Action Network's odds page. Collects data for the following categories:
Spread: Betting lines for the point spread of each game.
Total: Betting lines for the over/under (total points) for each game.
Moneyline (ML): Betting lines for moneyline odds for each team.
Saves the scraped data into a CSV file called NBAgame_lines_of_the_day.csv for later use.

**Updates**
Updated the script to account for when there are multiple games per day 

**Disclaimer**
This uses the best odds column on Action network that is why there may be a little discrepancy for some of the lines
